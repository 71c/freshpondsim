2.27 miles around not including around kingsley park
(measured with google maps)




Notes about edge cases for FreshPondPedestrian.__init__

if this is the case then complain:
travel_distance / abs(velocity) == 0
travel_distance >= 0, abs(velocity) >= 0

travel_distance / abs(velocity) == 0

if travel_distance == abs(velocity) == 0
travel no distance and do not move
time taken can be anything!
but minimum possible time taken would be 0

if travel_distance == 0 and abs(velocity) != 0
travel no distance (and do not move because travel no distance)
travel time can be anything!
but minimum possible time taken would be 0

if travel_distance != 0 and abs(velocity) == 0
travel some distance and do not move
impossible! (or infinite time to get there)

if travel_distance != 0 and abs(velocity) != 0
normal
